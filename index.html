        <h2>Classic 350 2021</h2>
        <p>
          The first generation Classic 350 and the Classic 500 feature the new
          unit construction engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants
          respectively. However the Classic 350 uses a carburettor for fuel
          delivery and the Classic 500 has EFI. The Classic 350 has an ammeter
          while the Classic 500 has a low fuel indicator light and engine check
          light instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on the Classic 350 is more
          of a vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use
          for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the
          top dead centre (CB points closed) then the ammeter would stay in the
          middle.
        </p>
        <p>  
          This feature allowed the rider to use the decompression lever
          to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative
          ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market
          segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500. Both
          the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 come in a variety of color
          options, including; Stealth Black, Chrome, Battle Green, and Gunmetal
          Grey. In 2017 Royal Enfield equipped Classic 500 models with Euro 4
          compliance which included ABS brakes for front and rear and better
          emission control system. In 2018 Royal Enfield released Classic 350
          models with ABS in some markets. In 2019 classic 500 production is
          stopped and company launches new bs6 engines and dual channel abs A
          final "end of build" production run of 1000 units is launched, Classic
          500 Tribute Black.

          Hunter Motorcycles was started with an intention to fill a niche for
          good looking learner street bikes. The founder started the company as
          his own children came of riding age, realising there was little choice
          of learner-specific bikes on the market. In 2014 the company was
          bought out by Hunter distributor Ben Namnik and the headquarters were
          moved from New South Wales to Western Australia.[2] In 2017 Hunter
          Motorcycles expanded into Nepal, New Zealand, Malaysia, Iran and
          Indonesia.
